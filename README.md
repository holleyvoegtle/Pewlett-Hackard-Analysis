# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis 
With the use of SQL, we are to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The reason we are doing this is that the company, Pewlett-Hackard has many employees that are approaching retirement in unprecedented numbers. Managers are calling this the “silver tsunami." Once these people are identified, then a program can be set up to mentor younger employees to eventually take their place. Once someone retires, all those years of experience and knowledge will be lost. If they are able to mentor, then the company can continue to grow and lessons that could have been lost, do not have to be repeated. 

## Results 
 Four major points from analyzing the data based on retiring age, titles, age, and how long the employee has been with the company is as follows:
1) There are a lot of employees that are retiring in the next few years
2) There are a number of employees that have changed their titles and received promotions through the years
3) There are are plenty of older employees who would be candidates for the mentorship program.
4) A mentorship is a great solution to have different generations bring their knowledge together and to make a sustainable and growing work force.

## Summary

How many roles will need the be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact? 
- There will almost 500,000 people retiring in the coming few years. This will make a huge impact on the company.

Are the enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor? 
- I feel that there are plenty of eligible candidates to start mentoring but it will have to happen quickly. In order for the mentorship program to succeed, there will have to be an all encompassing	program that can integrate across a few departments so that cross-training can be utilized.
